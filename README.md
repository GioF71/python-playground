Exercises and notes about my python learning path

## Credits

### Data Structures

#### Trees

Inspired from this repo: [Python data structures: Trees](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/python-data-structures-trees-2834010) by [Ryan Mitchell](https://github.com/REMitchell).  
Watching actively the real course on LinkedIn Learning is highly recommended. These are simply my notes and exercises.

### Dynamic Programming

Inspired from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk) by [Alvin Zablan](https://github.com/alvin-the-programmer) for [freeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org).  
These are my exercises using Python, while in the video Node.js is used.
