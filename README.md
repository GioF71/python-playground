## Credits

### DataStructure: Trees

Inspired from this repo: [Python data structures: Trees](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/python-data-structures-trees-2834010) by [Ryan Mitchell](https://github.com/REMitchell).  
Watching actively the real course is highly recommended. These are simply my notes and exercises.
